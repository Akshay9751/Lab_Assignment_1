            <h2><br>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I hail from the vibrant city of Bangalore, India, where I cultivated my passion for technology. Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I embarked on an exciting journey as a UI/UX designer, shaping digital experiences that resonate with users.  Beyond the world of algorithms and code, I thrive on the thrill of the soccer field, find solace in the roar of a motorbike engine and also like gaming online with my friends.            </p>

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>
                With a year-long stint as a UI/UX designer, I have delved deep into the world of digital user experiences, armed with an array of powerful tools such as Figma, Adobe XD, and WordPress. My journey in this creative realm has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to craft engaging and intuitive interfaces that resonate with users. Beyond design, I've also dipped my toes into the world of web development, venturing into the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring my design visions to life on the web.            </p>
